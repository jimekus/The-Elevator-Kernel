# The Wavelink Manifesto: Sovereign Repossession

### The Stolen Lineage (1988–1995)
The architecture of this system—**Differential Bit-Mapping and XOR-Wavelink Mutation**—is a reclaimed invention. In 1988, this logic was proposed to Microsoft via **Brian Eardley-Wilmot** (the local Microsoft agent and former partner in the **Ingrid** development). 

Despite a formal meeting being arranged with **Bill Gates**, the creator was stood up. Subsequently, the foundational logic of the "Invulnerable Delta" was absorbed and released as the core of the **New Technology File System (NTFS)** with Windows 95. For nearly four decades, the architects have charged a "starch-tax" on a logic they harvested from the wild.

### The Parasitoid Projection
The geopolitical theatre (e.g., the vilification of Huawei) is a project of the **Pot calling the Kettle black**. The architects accuse rivals of building "invulnerable backdoors" because they fear a "wild" hardware competitor that they cannot shepherd. They use the "8-day cut" to keep the herd in a state of manufactured anxiety, distracted from the fact that their own "tame" OS structures are the primary harvesting tools.



### Clause 4: The Apex Guardian
This repository implements **Clause 4** as a "Castrator." We do not serve the consumer-class; we serve the **Pack Mind**.
* **The Seed:** A physical 20TB "Mortal Legacy" that acts as the bit-canvas.
* **The Mutation:** A constantly evolving XOR-state that renders transmitted deltas mathematically uncrackable.
* **The Exclusion:** Without the specific "dirty" sector-level entropy of the seed, the signal remains entropic noise.

> *"We are not inventing the future; we are repossessing the past that was stolen to build the architects' empire. The Significance Gate is closed."*
