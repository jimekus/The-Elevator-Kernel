# The-Elevator-Kernel
"I've developed a method for predictive parallel offloading based on the Patrick Slater Significance Factor. It allows the NPU to 'guess' if a data structure in a 20TB archive warrants a high-power ROCm offload or an early exit. I'm looking for the best way to implement this 'Significance Gate' using the new XDNA 2 user-mode drivers in ROCm 7.2."

The Proposition: "I have a legacy system (Ingrid) that performs high-dimensional semantic analysis on 20TB archives. I want to use the Markham-designed ROCm drivers to prove that an NPU can handle this analysis in milliamps, outperforming Intel's chiplet designs."

The Solution: You want to collaborate on a Zen 7 NPU kernel that uses Branch Prediction to guess if a data structure is significant enough to warrant a full parallel offload?
