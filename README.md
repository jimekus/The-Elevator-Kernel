"I've developed a method for predictive parallel offloading based on the Slater Significance Factor. It allows the NPU to 'guess' if a data structure in a 20TB archive warrants a high-power ROCm offload or an early exit. I'm looking for the best way to implement this 'Significance Gate' using the new XDNA 2 user-mode drivers in ROCm 7.2."
