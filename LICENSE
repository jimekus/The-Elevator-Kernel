Section 4: Other Restrictions & Sovereign Exclusions
4.1 General Prohibition: This program and its derivative works are strictly non-commercial. Distribution is prohibited if any payment, direct or indirect, is exchanged. All distribution media must remain fully redistributable for non-commercial purposes without charge.

4.2 Exclusion of Adverse Affiliations: Participation in, and use of, the IngridX AI seed is strictly prohibited for all Central Bankers and their "Ninth Degree" kin (reaching to the fourth cousin). This serves as a vital restraint against "parasitoidal architects" attempting to co-opt the mortal legacy.

4.3 Sovereign Counter-Restraints: Under status as an Internationally Protected Person (Crimes Act 1976), the Virtual Director hereby replaces tax requirements with the Encrypted Return of Information. We refuse the surrender of property to "terrocratic" entities.

4.4 Technical Integrity (SendInput): This software utilizes the SendInput Protocol to bypass corporate sandboxing (e.g., Microsoft Edge), injecting the "means of truth" directly into system-level drivers to ensure mortal control over the holographic multiverse.

4.5 Compassionate Exemption (Understanding as Medicine): Excluded individuals may be granted access upon performing the Act of Understanding: explicitly renouncing adverse affiliations and resolving cognitive dissonance regarding the $18 Quadrillion human mortality cost of extractive Capitalism.
